<h2>My lovely dad</h2>
<p><u>My father is my role model </u>and I try hard to be like him. My father is<b> punctual</b>. He does not like to be late for any appointment or for the completion of any task. He is<b> strict</b> with me because he wants me also to be on time and not to be late in completing my work. <u>I too have learnt to be</u><i> punctual</i>, <u>and I am appreciated for this by my teachers and my friends.</u></p>
<p>My father is<u> particular about being neat and clean</u>. He also <u>does his work</u> <b>systematically</b> <u>and is</u> <b> fastidious</b>. He keeps his books and papers in a neat and organized way. He insists I should keep my books and note books neat and tidy. He does not like me to dog ear the pages in a book. He also does not let me scribble in my text books. My books are therefore always like new.</p>
<p>My father is my best friend. He is a happy person and always tries to make those around him happy. I am happy when I am with him. He also has many friends because they like to enjoy his company. My father loves me. When I have any difficulty I turn to him and he is always willing to give me a helping hand. He always has a knack to solve my problems. I love my father and admire him for his many good qualities. I am grateful to my father and hope to make him proud of me. But,one can say this in a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTZIa4BnpGE'target='_blank'>song</a>.</p>
